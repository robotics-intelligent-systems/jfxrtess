# Real-Time Embedded Systems Simulation

Real-time simulation and testing encompasses rapid control prototyping, DSP and vision system prototyping, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. You can test a control system design running on target computer hardware while it is connected to your physical plant or system. Libcanard is a compact implementation of the Cyphal/CAN protocol stack in C99/C11 for high-integrity real-time embedded systems. Sunflower is a full-system emulator for embedded sensing, computation, communication, fault modeling, power dissipation, batteries, and more. The Real-Time Robot Arm Simulator is an open-source project creating a KUKA KR 700 PA-inspired virtual robotic arm using Blender and Python/Rust. The DLR URDFModelica Library is an open-source library for simulation of robots described as URDF. Library for modelling of Delta Robots. ROS 2 packages for the ROBOTIS OpenMANIPULATOR platform provide the necessary interfaces and tools to control the robot, integrate with its sensors, and develop physical AI applications. Modular HHCM app will genereate URDF, SRDF and a complete ROS package, which can be used to simulate and control the robot.
