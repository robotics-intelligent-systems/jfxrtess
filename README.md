# Real-Time Embedded Systems Simulation

Apache Ditto is a software framework for digital twins, a virtual representation of devices in the real world. Libcanard is a compact implementation of the Cyphal/CAN protocol stack in C99/C11 for high-integrity real-time embedded systems. Sunflower is a full-system emulator for embedded sensing, computation, communication, fault modeling, power dissipation, batteries, and more. The Real-Time Robot Arm Simulator is an open-source project creating a KUKA KR 700 PA-inspired virtual robotic arm using Blender and Python/Rust. The DLR URDFModelica Library is an open-source library for simulation of robots described as URDF. Library for modelling of Delta Robots. ROS 2 packages for the ROBOTIS OpenMANIPULATOR platform provide the necessary interfaces and tools to control the robot, integrate with its sensors, and develop physical AI applications. Modular HHCM app will genereate URDF, SRDF and a complete ROS package, which can be used to simulate and control the robot. Ubuntu kernels which are optimized for NVIDIA server systems. Libvirt provides a portable, long term stable C API for managing the virtualization technologies provided by many operating systems. Mininet emulates a complete network of hosts, links, and switches on a single machine. Ryu is a component-based software defined networking framework. Floodlight is designed to work with the growing number of switches, routers, virtual switches, and access points that support the OpenFlow standard. ONOS : Open Network Operating System. An SDK (Software Development Kit) for building commercial-grade, AI-native, 3GPP, and O-RAN compliant 5G/6G gNB software on NVIDIA-accelerated computing platforms
