# Real-Time Embedded Systems Simulation

Real-time simulation and testing encompasses rapid control prototyping, DSP and vision system prototyping, and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation. You can test a control system design running on target computer hardware while it is connected to your physical plant or system. Libcanard is a compact implementation of the Cyphal/CAN protocol stack in C99/C11 for high-integrity real-time embedded systems. Sunflower is a full-system emulator for embedded sensing, computation, communication, fault modeling, power dissipation, batteries, and more.
